                    What Are Ductable Air Conditioners?
                </h2>
                <p style={{ lineHeight: '1.6', marginBottom: '20px' }}>
                    It also referred to as ducted AC systems, is designed for large spaces where centralized air conditioning is required. These systems use a system of ducts and vents to distribute cool air across a big area, thus ideal for commercial buildings, office spaces, large homes, etc. Unlike split or window AC systems, suitable AC units are installed discreetly and mostly behind the ceiling or walls, providing a clean, aesthetic look with minimal noise and disruption.
                </p>
                <p style={{ lineHeight: '1.6', marginBottom: '20px' }}>
                    Such systems have outstanding energy efficiency, are silent, and possess some of the best cooling performance, especially when cooling multiple rooms or zones together. However, like every other air conditioning system, ductable air conditioners require regular maintenance, timely repairs, and sometimes replacement to function at maximum efficiency.
