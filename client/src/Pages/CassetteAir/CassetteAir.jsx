                General AC Inspection and Diagnosis </h2>
                <p style={{ lineHeight: '1.6', marginBottom: '20px' }}>
                In the first place, we thoroughly check the system to point out any problems that may have been lying beneath and would reduce the performance. Technicians check for all parts, from electric connections and airflow to refrigerant levels. This makes sure your cassette AC is adequately running to avoid any future breakdown.

                <p style={{ lineHeight: '1.6', marginBottom: '20px' }}>
                Cleaning or replacing the AC filters regularly maintains healthy airflow and cooling; dirty filters degrade the efficiency of the system as well as air quality, which means there is increased energy consumption and overload on the system.

                <p style={{ lineHeight: '1.6', marginBottom: '20px' }}>
                This process requires that the compressor and motor, which are the primary elements critical to the cooling performance of this appliance, be inspected. Wear, damage, and malfunction in these components need to be identified early to avoid major breakdowns and keep the air conditioner running quietly with optimal energy use.
