                <p style={{ lineHeight: '1.6', marginBottom: '20px' }}>
                    A heat pump is an efficient system that can both heat and cool a building using heat transfer. In
                    winter, it takes the heat from outside air or ground and carries it inside the premises; in summer, it
                    reverses the process to cool the space. Contrary to ordinary heating systems where heat is produced,
                    heat pumps do the opposite in that they use electricity to move the heat, making them highly efficient
                    and environmentally friendly. In air-source, ground-source (geothermal), and water-source varieties,
                    heat pumps provide an ecologically sound, cost-efficient solution for year-round climate control in a
                    broad range of residential and commercial applications, suitable to moderate climates which also
                    results in the need for heat pump installation services in Delhi to ensure continuity.

                    How Heat Pumps Work: Efficient Heating and Cooling
                </h2>
                <p style={{ lineHeight: '1.6', marginBottom: '20px' }}>
                    A heat pump operates based on the principle of transferring rather than producing heat. In the heating
                    mode, it draws heat from the outside air, ground, or water and moves it indoors. In cooling mode, it
                    reverses this trend, taking heat from the inside and transporting it out to the outside air, like an
                    air conditioner. Due to a cycle of refrigerant, heat pumps are quite energy-efficient in providing
                    climate control throughout the year with considerable savings in energy compared to a traditional
                    system.
